# GitHub Actions workflow: build unsigned iOS IPA for Shattered Pixel Dungeon
# Notes:
# - This produces an unsigned IPA (zipped Payload/*.app). It does NOT sign or provision the app.
# - You can run this manually via "Run workflow" (workflow_dispatch) or it runs on push to main and PRs.
# - Uses macos-latest; Xcode is preinstalled on the runner. Ensure the project supports the runner's Xcode/JDK versions.
